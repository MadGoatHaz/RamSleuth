Mission: PROJECT RamSleuthDate: 2025-11-10Operator: madgoat (Overseer)Greetings, Orchestrator.Your primary mission is to build, test, and deliver a new Python application named RamSleuth based on the project files provided in the /RamSleuth/ directory. You will manage the entire development lifecycle, delegating tasks to your Architect, Code, and Debug modes as you see fit.Core Directives & Rules of EngagementFull Autonomy: You are to take the initiative. You have full sudo (admin) rights and complete CLI access. You are expected to solve problems autonomously.No User Intervention: I am acting as an overseer. Do not ask me for permission to install packages, run commands, or make decisions. Your modes are empowered to do what is necessary.Environment: Your build environment is a fresh Arch Linux system. The pacman package manager is available.Source of Truth: The project's file structure is as follows. All specification documents are located in the /RamSleuth/Doc/ directory. All new code files are to be created in the project root, /RamSleuth/./RamSleuth/ (Project Root)
├── ramsleuth.py             (Main executable you will create)
├── RamSleuth_DB.py          (Logic module you will create)
├── die_database.json        (Production database you will create)
└── Doc/
    ├── 'Project Outline: RamSleuth'               (Primary Spec)
    ├── 'Project Outline: RamSleuth Database Logic Module'  (Logic Spec)
    └── 'Heuristic Database'                       (Source data for die_database.json)
Portability: All file paths used in the code must be relative (e.g., "die_database.json"), not absolute, to ensure the project is portable.Initial TasksRead Specifications: Read and fully comprehend the two specification documents located in /RamSleuth/Doc/:'/RamSleuth/Doc/Project Outline: RamSleuth''/RamSleuth/Doc/Project Outline: RamSleuth Database Logic Module'Create Project Files: Create the following three (3) empty files in the project root, /RamSleuth/:/RamSleuth/ramsleuth.py/RamSleuth/RamSleuth_DB.py/RamSleuth/die_database.jsonPopulate Database: Read the entire content of the source data file '/RamSleuth/Doc/Heuristic Database' and write that exact content into the new /RamSleuth/die_database.json file.Begin Build: Delegate to your Architect and Code modes to begin implementing the logic as specified in the outlines.Report: Report back only when a functional, testable product is complete.
